# `acmesh-netcup`
Welcome to `acmesh-netcup` ðŸŽ‰

`acmesh-netcup` is a simple [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) based container with a trivial helper
script easily to issue p384 certificates using the [netcup](https://netcup.de/) DNS API.

## Example
See the [Docker-Compose.yml](Docker-Compose.yml) file as example. Then simply execute
`docker-compose run certbot-netcup` to issue the certificates and copy them to the mounted volume.
